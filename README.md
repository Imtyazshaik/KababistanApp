Excited to share a glimpse of my latest Android project built using Kotlin + Jetpack Compose 🚀

I’ve been working on a complete Food Ordering & Table Reservation App with a modern, production-style UI/UX, covering both User and Admin flows.

🍽️ User App Highlights
• Home screen with categories, search, special offers, and location-based restaurant view
• Special Offers module with coupon codes and discounts
• Dynamic menu with ratings, pricing, favorites, and add-to-cart
• Smart Cart with empty state handling and checkout flow
• Order History & Reservation tracking
• Table Reservation with date, time, guest count, and contact details
• Restaurant closed-time validation with user-friendly alerts
• Profile & account management

🛠️ Admin Panel Features
• Pickup order tracking
• Reservation management
• Order status handling (Completed / Rejected)
• Receipt generation
• Order & reservation history

📱 What I Worked With
• Kotlin
• Jetpack Compose
• MVVM Architecture
• Navigation Components
• State Management
• Material Design 3
• Clean, responsive UI & real-world business rules (store hours, validation, flows)

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in building an end-to-end Android application with scalable UI architecture, real-time state handling, form validations, and business logic implementation.

Currently enhancing it with:
➡️ Backend integration
➡️ Payment gateway
➡️ Real-time order tracking & notifications

Sharing a few screenshots and a demo video from the app. Proud of the progress and excited to keep improving it!
