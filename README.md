• Clean UI/UX with responsive layouts

This project helped me strengthen my hands-on skills in building production-style Android apps, handling real-time states, form validations, business rules (like store hours), and scalable UI architecture.

Proud of the progress and continuously improving it with backend integration, payment gateway, and live order tracking next.
