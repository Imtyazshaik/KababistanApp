This version significantly simplifies the preparation in the interest of time without compromising its appeal: varied flavors and textures from crispy, caramelized eggplant; creamy, garlicky yogurt; sweet and sour tomatoes; and juicy, bright pomegranate seeds. No soaking or simmering here, just quick pan-frying and layering for the same effect in about 30 minutes. Go back for seconds of a dish that tastes even better when it’s cold.&nbsp;</p></div></div><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k topnote_showMore__e4U16" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Read More</span></button></div></div><ul class="recipeintro_tools-block__c81nP"><li><div class="popover_popover-container__huJIK"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_primary__Hsbni saveorganize_unsavedButton__jYqLm" type="button"><svg width="20" height="20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14.706 4.294H6.294v10.587l4.206-2.669 4.206 2.67V4.293ZM5 3h11v14.235l-5.5-3.49-5.5 3.49V3Z" fill="#fff"></path></svg><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Save</span></button><div style="opacity:0" class="popover_popover__Yn69l popover_position-bottom___YMPK popover_popover--logged-out-message__yMhe_"><div class="popover_popover-body__aWR9h popover_popover-body--message__fjyF9"><div><p class="pantry--ui"><button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k popover_popover--logged-out-action__FUUmm" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Log in</span></button> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <button class="button_button__tgtQk button_unstyled__DbQ5k popover_popover--logged-out-action__FUUmm" type="button"><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">sign up</span></button> <!-- -->to save this recipe.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="buttondialog_container__zx4HK"><button aria-label="Gift Recipe" class="button_button__tgtQk button_default__wXRq7 giftrecipe_giftButton__QGTzQ giftrecipe_nonSubGiftButton__yqv2N" type="button" data-testid="gift-recipe-button"><svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 25 20" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18.29 5.42h-2.32a3.18 3.18 0 0 0 .05-3.37A3.1 3.1 0 0 0 13.96.68a3.52 3.52 0 0 0-2.5.48 3.86 3.86 0 0 0-1.55 2.37 3.79 3.79 0 0 0-1.55-2.37A3.49 3.49 0 0 0 5.87.68a3.08 3.08 0 0 0-2.06 1.37 3.16 3.16 0 0 0 0 3.37H1.54a1 1 0 0 0-.94.95v3.64a1 1 0 0 0 .94.95h.23v7.24a1.16 1.16 0 0 0 1.15 1.15h14a1.15 1.15 0 0 0 1.14-1.15v-7.24h.23a1 1 0 0 0 1-.95V6.37a1 1 0 0 0-1-.95Zm-1.73 5.59v6.84h-5.9v-6.84h5.9Zm-5.44-5.82.17-1.13a2.47 2.47 0 0 1 1-1.65 2 2 0 0 1 1.41-.28 1.65 1.65 0 0 1 1.08.72 1.78 1.78 0 0 1-.53 2.31l-3.13.03Zm6.61 1.73v2.54h-7.07V6.92h7.07Zm-8.57 4.09v6.84H3.29v-6.84h5.87ZM5.08 2.85a1.6 1.6 0 0 1 1.07-.72 2 2 0 0 1 1.41.28A2.37 2.37 0 0 1 8.49 4l.21 1.19H5.61a1.77 1.77 0 0 1-.53-2.34Zm4.08 4.07v2.54H2.1V6.92h7.06Z" fill="#231F20"></path></svg><span class="button_buttonText__75JJj">Give</span></button><dialog id=":R1a6damm:" class="buttondialog_dialog__7YnSE" data-testid="gift-recipe-button-dialog"><h2 class="pantry--ui-lg-strong"><span class="Menu_nonbreakingSpan__ghOU_">Subscriber benefit:</span> <span class="Menu_nonbreakingSpan__ghOU_">Give recipes to anyone</span></h2><p class="pantry--ui">As a subscriber, you have<!-- --> <strong>10<!-- --> gift recipes</strong> to give each month.
